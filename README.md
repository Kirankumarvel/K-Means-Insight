# K-Means Insight: Clustering for Customer Segmentation & Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
K-Means Insight is a powerful machine-learning project that applies K-Means clustering to analyze and segment customer data. The project utilizes synthetic datasets and real-world customer data to demonstrate the effectiveness of clustering in uncovering meaningful patterns.

## 🚀 Features
- **K-Means Clustering:** Implements clustering with k=3, k=4, and k=5 to observe variations.
- **Synthetic Data Clustering:** Generates and visualizes clustered data using `make_blobs()`.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segments real customer data based on Age, Education, and Income.
- **Standardization:** Uses `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.
- **Visualization:** Includes 2D scatter plots and interactive 3D visualizations with `plotly`.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot of Data Points**
- **Clustered Data with Different k Values**
- **Customer Segmentation by Age & Income**
- **Interactive 3D Plot (Education, Age, Income)**

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kirankumarvel/K-Means-Insight.git
   cd K-Means-Insight
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn plotly
   ```

3. **Run the script**
   ```sh
   python K-Means-Customer-Seg.py
   ```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy & Pandas
- Scikit-learn (K-Means Algorithm)
- Matplotlib & Plotly (Visualization)

## 📖 How It Works
1. Generates synthetic data with predefined clusters.
2. Applies K-Means clustering on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
3. Compares different cluster sizes (k=3, k=4, k=5).
4. Visualizes customer segmentation using 2D and interactive 3D plots.

## 📈 Results
The project helps to:
✅ Identify customer groups based on similar characteristics.  
✅ Optimize marketing strategies using data-driven clustering.  
✅ Improve business decision-making by understanding customer behavior.
